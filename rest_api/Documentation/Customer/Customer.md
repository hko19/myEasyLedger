## Customer
`Customer` objects represent clients of an Organization. A Customer object belongs to exactly one Organization; an Organization may 'own' many Customer objects. A JournalEntry object can be assigned to a Customer.

From a technical standpoint, Customers and Vendors function in exactly the same way, but are recorded in separate tables in the database.
