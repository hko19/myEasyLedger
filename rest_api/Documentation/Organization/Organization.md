## Organization

Organizations represent owners of entries and real-world organizations that use the Easy Ledger software. An organization may have one or many users. The API allows you to create, retrieve, update, and delete organizations, retrieve a list of all organizations, as well as retrieve all entries owned by a certain organization and all people that are a member of a certain organization. Future versions of the API will allow you to retrieve a list of all accounts owned by an organization.
