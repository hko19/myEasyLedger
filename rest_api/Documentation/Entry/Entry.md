## Entry
The `Entry` object represents an atomic submission of data into a ledger. Entry data is stored in the entry as LineItem objects, which represent single line-items in a double-entry style ledger book. LineItems must be submitted or updated as part of an entry, and cannot be created or updated piecemeal. The API allows you to retrieve, delete, create, and update entries, and retrieve a list of all entries. It also allows you to retrieve a server-paginated list of all entries as view models, sorted by most recent entryDate.
