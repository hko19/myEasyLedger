## AccountType


AccountTypes represent the main categories of accounts. The API allows you to retrieve a list of all account types, a single account type, a list of existing categories for the specified account type, or a list of existing subtypes for the specified account type. The account types are provided as metadata, and the client should assume the following values at all time:

|ID|Name|
|--|--------------|
|1|Assets|
|2|Liabilities|
|3|Owner's Equity|
|4|Income|
|5|Expenses|
