## AccountSubtype

AccountSubtypes represent subtypes of the main types of accounts, e.g. lines of credit, mortgage accounts, checking accounts, savings accounts, etc. The API allows you to create, retrieve, update, and delete an account subtype, as well as list all subtypes. Unlike an account type, subtypes are user-supplied. Generally speaking, users should only use subtypes for the asset, liability, and equity types. Income and expense account types should use Category instead.
