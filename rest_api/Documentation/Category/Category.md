## Category


Categories represent categories of expenses and income, e.g. dining, education, etc. The API allows you to create, retrieve, update, and delete a category, as well as list all categories. Unlike an account type, categories are user-supplied. Generally speaking, users should only use categories for the income and expense types. asset and liability account types should use AccountSubtype instead.
