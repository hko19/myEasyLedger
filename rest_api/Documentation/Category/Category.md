## Category


Categories represent categories of expenses and income, e.g. dining, education, etc, and belong to expense and income accounts. The API allows you to create, retrieve, update, and delete a category, as well as list all categories. Categories are user-supplied. Generally speaking, users should only use categories for the income and expense types. asset, liability, and equity account types should use AccountSubtype instead.
