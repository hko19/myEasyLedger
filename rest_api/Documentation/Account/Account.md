## Account
Accounts represent single accounts, lines of credit, expense books, etc. that a user owns. A user can and usually will have many accounts. Accounts are affected by LineItems and owned by Organizations. The API allows you to create, retrieve, update, and delete accounts, as well as retrieve a list of all accounts. Future versions of the API will allow you to retrieve all LineItems for an account.
