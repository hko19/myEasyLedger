The id of the organization that this account belongs to.

- **organizationName (`String`)** <br/>

- **debitTotal (`BigDecimal`)** <br/>
The total debit balance of this account. This should equal initialDebitAmount plus the sum of all debit LineItems affecting this account. **In the event that you are requesting account totals for date ranges, debitTotal and creditTotal are the fields of interest.** The raw sum of LineItem totals will be displayed in a separate `sumOfDebitLineItem / sumOfCreditLineItem` field. The debitTotal and creditTotal fields will be equal to the sum of all debit/credit LineItems plus initialDebitAmount/initialCreditAmount when user requests balances up to a certain date (including the default case of requesting balances inclusive of all entries entered into the database), and will be equal to the sum of all debit/credit items without initial values added if a date range with a discrete start and end date is requested.

- **creditTotal (`BigDecimal`)** <br/>
The total credit balance of this account. This should equal initialCreditAmount plus the sum of all credit LineItems affecting this account. **In the event that you are requesting account totals for date ranges, debitTotal and creditTotal are the fields of interest.** The raw sum of LineItem totals will be displayed in a separate `sumOfDebitLineItem / sumOfCreditLineItem` field. The debitTotal and creditTotal fields will be equal to the sum of all debit/credit LineItems plus initialDebitAmount/initialCreditAmount when user requests balances up to a certain date (including the default case of requesting balances inclusive of all entries entered into the database), and will be equal to the sum of all debit/credit items without initial values added if a date range with a discrete start and end date is requested.

- **initialDebitAmount (`BigDecimal`)** <br/>
The debit amount that this account was initialized with. By default this is zero, but users migrating from other software may find it useful to initialize an account with non-zero values.

- **initialCreditAmount (`BigDecimal`)** <br/>
The credit amount that this account was initialized with. By default this is zero, but users migrating from other software may find it useful to initialize an account with non-zero values.

- **debitsMinusCredits (`BigDecimal`)** <br/>
For utility's sake we provide debitTotal-creditTotal as totalDebitsMinusCredits.

- **cashItem** (boolean) <br/>
Boolean flag determining whether this account should be treated as a cash item on the cash flow statement. By default, accounts should inherit this field from their parent account if they have one, or from their account subtype if they have no parent account, but users should be able to override this if they wish. See [[Reports#Custom report format positions]]

- **relevantToTaxesPaid** (boolean) <br/>
Boolean flag determining whether this account should be treated as relevant to taxes paid on the cash flow statement. Liabilities with this flag are treated as 'taxes payable', and expenses with this flag are treated as 'tax expense' items. 'Taxes paid' is calculated by total tax expense minus total taxes payable.
