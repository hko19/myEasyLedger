The debitTotal and creditTotal fields will be equal to the sum of all debit/credit LineItems plus initialDebitAmount/initialCreditAmount when user requests balances up to a certain date (including the default case of requesting balances inclusive of all entries entered into the database), and will be equal to the sum of all debit/credit items without initial values added if a date range with a discrete start and end date is requested.

- **creditTotal (`BigDecimal`)** <br/>
The total credit balance of this account. This should equal initialCreditAmount plus the sum of all credit LineItems affecting this account. **In the event that you are requesting account totals for date ranges, debitTotal and creditTotal are the fields of interest.** The raw sum of LineItem totals will be displayed in a separate `sumOfDebitLineItem / sumOfCreditLineItem` field.
