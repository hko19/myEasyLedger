AccountGroups are user-editable groups of accounts. They are children of AccountSubtype; each AccountGroup must belong to exactly one AccountSubtype. By default, when an organization is created, it is populated with one AccountGroup corresponding to each AccountSubtype. The may add, delete, and edit AccountGroups, but they are required to specify an AccountSubtype for each AccountGroup to ensure correct generation of financial statements and reports.
